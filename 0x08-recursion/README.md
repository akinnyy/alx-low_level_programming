Repeatedly calling a particularly function or blockofcodes can be done in two major ways:


1. Iteratively : Here we use loops to repeatedly call such functions or code blocks.

2. Recursively : Where a function or blocks of code call itself.

Having considered the first method in previous lessons,this project will be dedicated to the method of recursion. 

Let's get started with the recursion fun!
