This project discusses about pointers to a function.  Several manipulations are seen in various exercises to justify the importance of this concept. Pointers of a function points to the code and not the data.It provide easy pathway to call a function within another by pointing the the former.

This helps to reduce redundancy and in ome cases repetition of codes or codeblocks.
